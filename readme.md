# Playing Cards
The goal of this project is to excersise some basic skill in Java and also to show you can problem solve without a step-by-step spec to build from.

For this project you will work with your team to use the DrawingPanel to draw at least 4 unique playing cards of different numbers and suites. Abstract like processess and re-use as much code as possible.

The best versions of this assignment will include a clear task list, outlining what is to be done and when and by whom. Each team member must have a section of the code that is clearly their own and all team members must be able to explain all aspects of the code.

The best versions will also include more than 4 cards and potentially face cards. You may examine other technologies besides the included DrawingPanel, but it is not required that you do so. 

If your cards can be designed for future use beyond this assignment, that too will be rewarded in the grading. But, it is required that you have the minimum number of cards by the deadline to show that you have planned your task in a reasonable fashion.
